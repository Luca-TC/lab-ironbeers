tagline: 'Our Ruthless IPA With A Dark Malt Twist.',
first_brewed: '06/2016',
description: 'Jack Hammer has been single handedly ripping it up for quite some time. Now, the definitive bitter and
twisted IPA, has spawned four Hammer Head off-springs. Black Hammer is the second of our hyped up hybrid IPAs. A black
hearted beast, that takes no prisoners. American hops and dark malt combine to make mischief. Grapefruit and coffee
collide in sensory overload – a wake-up call for other IPA’s. Molten waves of pithy grapefruit build and finally ebb to
the roasty bitter onslaught. Stand firm and wield the Black Hammer with care. Stare into the black abyss and succumb to
the dark-side.',
